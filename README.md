## REQUIREMENTS

The application is containerized using docker üê≥ for development purpose.

Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Mac or Windows. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) will be automatically installed. On Linux, make sure you have the latest version of [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).


## COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS

Simply run the following command to start the application. 

```shell
docker build --tag image_quality_evaluation . # this will run create a docker image of the application 
docker run -p 5000:5000 image_quality_evaluation #this will run the application and maps local machine 5000 port to docker's 5000 port
```

Once completed, we can access the application by visiting <http://localhost:5000> on our browser.


## EXAMPLES OF USE

We can upload the png image from file upload. It will then convert the file into `JPEG, WEBP, AVIF and HEIF` formats. From the output fomats it quality metrics such as `MSE, PSNR and SSIM` to compare the results. The loading time is also compared to render the image.

One can use the cameraman.png attached in this project to test the results.

> **Note**
> HEIF image are not supported in most of the [browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=heif) so one might see broken images for unsupported browser.
